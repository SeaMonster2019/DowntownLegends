# DowntownLegends
This is a Cocos2dx3.17 engine game developed in C++language. I am using materials from the "Downtown" series of games.

I'm sorry, I don't have enough time and ability to complete this project. It's just a semi-finished product. 

I am programming games in a Windows system environment, but this program can be directly ported to other operating systems, requiring simple configuration of the project. 

# Usage
After you clone this project, you can use VS to open the "/proj. win32/Downtown. sln" VS project file. 
Alternatively, there is a compiled exe file in the "proj. win32 Debug. win32" folder. You can run this game on a Windows 32-bit system.
