# DowntownLegends
This is a Cocos2dx3.17.2 engine game. I am using materials from the "Downtown" series of games. This game code can only be used for learning and communication, and will not be used for commercial purposes.

I'm sorry, I don't have enough time and ability to complete this project. It's just a semi-finished product. 

# Usage
After you clone this project, you can use VS to open the "/proj. win32/Downtown. sln" VS project file. 
Alternatively, there is a compiled exe file in the "proj. win32 Debug. win32" folder.
